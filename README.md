# The-Wise-Box

Wise box is a web application coded in python with the streamlit library

Its purpose is to categorize english articles as fake news or real news through the use of NLP, ML and DL. 

The algorithm has been trained on a part of the FNC data set which is unfortunately not up to date with the news.
